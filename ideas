Obviously buy() method is getting in the way of the count method. THink of a solution to this. 

Seperate Scaper class into a different file

Give Scraper class __name__ == ""__main__" functionality as post that as the Amazon Web Scraper for now.

Get some images of the product page, the inspect bar and your output

Should I make it so that buying a product automatically deletes it? The system become a tool for users to track what htye want to buy

or I can go with the number count idea
