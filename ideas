I need to fix the listing of the products Test #8: Command line functionality, probelm, for bought it shows 1

Might want to add a cleanse functionality that allows all bought products of a user to be deleted. Fresh slate

Add logging through Modifer class. Will use grep to view all user activity. Make viewing all you activity an option in the user-interface

I should be able to dockerize this application pretty easily
I mean the tutorial deals with pio dependencies, requirements.txt, adding files, and the file you want to run.
That's all I have in my application, right?

keep cmd-testing until you finish the system. Eventually, though, you will have to ditch it. MAKE A COMMIT BEFORE DITCHING IT FOR THE FINAL SYSTEM AND THE FINAL DATABASE. MIGHT BE A BRANCH POINT IN THE FUTURE

when you beleive the main-logic is all done, you start making the user interface. MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT BEFORE STARTING THE USER-INTERFACE.
MIGHT BE A BRNAHC POINT IN THE FUTURE
