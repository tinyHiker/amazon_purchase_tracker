Do some research of logging


I should be able to dockerize this application pretty easily
I mean the tutorial deals with pio dependencies, requirements.txt, adding files, and the file you want to run.
That's all I have in my application, right?

keep cmd-testing until you finish the system. Eventually, though, you will have to ditch it. MAKE A COMMIT BEFORE DITCHING IT FOR THE FINAL SYSTEM AND THE FINAL DATABASE. MIGHT BE A BRANCH POINT IN THE FUTURE

when you beleive the main-logic is all done, you start making the user interface. MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT BEFORE STARTING THE USER-INTERFACE.
MIGHT BE A BRNAHC POINT IN THE FUTURE
