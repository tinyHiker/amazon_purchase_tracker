After this, all main functionality will be done. Proceed to figure out what to do with the file organization problem. I think I should move EVEYRHTING INTO A SEPERATE FOLDER, 
THEN PUT OLY THE MAIN SYSTEMS NECESSARY PARTS INTO THE MAIN FOLDER.
FOr the main-system, we don't need command_line_testing.py, the batch script or view_database and the create_database_for_testing files


keep cmd-testing until you finish the system. Eventually, though, you will have to ditch it. MAKE A COMMIT BEFORE DITCHING IT FOR THE FINAL SYSTEM AND THE FINAL DATABASE. MIGHT BE A BRANCH POINT IN THE FUTURE

when you beleive the main-logic is all done, you start making the user interface. MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT BEFORE STARTING THE USER-INTERFACE.
MIGHT BE A BRNAHC POINT IN THE FUTURE


I should be able to dockerize this application pretty easily
I mean the tutorial deals with pio dependencies, requirements.txt, adding files, and the file you want to run.
That's all I have in my application, right?

Start user_interface
